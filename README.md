**Kaggle Dataset Downloader and AlexNet Implementation**

**Introduction**

This repository provides code to download datasets from Kaggle using two different methods and implements the AlexNet architecture for image classification. The dataset used in the demonstration is the Intel Image Classification dataset.

**Prerequisites**

Install the Kaggle package by running !pip install kaggle.
Make sure to have a Kaggle account and generate an API key. Upload the API key to the notebook as explained in the code.
The opendatasets package is required for the second method of downloading Kaggle datasets. Install it using !pip install opendatasets --upgrade.

**Method 1: Kaggle Recommended Method**

Upload your Kaggle API key by running the provided code.
Specify the Kaggle dataset you want to download using !kaggle datasets download -d DATASET_NAME.
The dataset will be downloaded and saved in the current working directory.

**Method 2: Using Open Datasets**

Upload your Kaggle API key by running the provided code.
Use the opendatasets library to download Kaggle datasets. Specify the dataset URL.
The dataset will be downloaded and saved in the specified destination directory.

**Intel Image Classification Dataset**

Load and preprocess the Intel Image Classification dataset.
Implement the AlexNet architecture for image classification.
Train the model on the dataset and visualize training/validation accuracy and loss.
Save the trained model weights.

**Loading Pretrained Model**

Load the pretrained AlexNet model using the saved weights.
Evaluate the model on the test dataset and print accuracy.
Generate predictions and create a confusion matrix.
Confusion Matrix Visualization
Visualize the confusion matrix using seaborn heatmap.

**Conclusion**

The provided code demonstrates two methods to download Kaggle datasets and implements the AlexNet architecture for image classification. The results include accuracy, precision scores, and a confusion matrix. Feel free to adapt the code for your specific Kaggle dataset and image classification tasks.
